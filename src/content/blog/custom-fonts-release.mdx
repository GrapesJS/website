## A New Era for Fonts in Studio ‚úçÔ∏è

Until now, Studio SDK projects shipped with a limited set of system fonts‚Äîthink Arial, Times New Roman, and other safe but uninspiring choices. That changes today.

We're excited to introduce **[full font management support](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/configuration/fonts)** across all project types: **[Web](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/project-types/web)**, **[Email](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/project-types/email)**, and the brand-new **[Document](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/project-types/document)** mode.

Whether you're looking to preload brand fonts, offer your users access to thousands of Google Fonts, or define your own custom font provider, the new **[Font Manager]((https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/configuration/fonts))** makes it easy.

## Why It Matters

Typography is core to design. It defines tone, branding, legibility‚Äîand now, Studio SDK gives you full control over it.

Teams can now:

- Offer a curated list of brand-approved fonts  
- Pull in Google Fonts with zero setup  
- Manage font visibility and defaults for different projects  
- Extend with internal or self-hosted fonts  
- Preview fonts visually inside the dropdown, instantly  

This brings professional-grade typographic control to every design‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a landing page, a marketing email, or a print-ready invoice.

## Font Manager ‚Äì At a Glance

üîß **Key features**:

- **Google Fonts Support** ‚Äì Plug-and-play access via built-in provider plugin  
- **Font Preloading** ‚Äì Define fonts that are always loaded into the editor via Global Page Settings

- **Dropdown Customization** ‚Äì Choose which fonts appear, and in what order

## How It Works

To enable font support, simply activate the Font Manager in your configuration:

```js
fonts: {
  enableFontManager: true,
}
```

From there, fonts are managed directly through the visual editor. Users can open the Typography panel, click the ‚ûï icon in the Font dropdown, and add fonts on the fly‚Äîwhether they‚Äôre standard system fonts or imported via plugins.

To support Google Fonts, use the built-in [plugin](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/plugins/asset-providers/google-fonts):

```js

import { googleFontsAssetProvider } from '@grapesjs/studio-sdk-plugins';

plugins: [
  googleFontsAssetProvider.init({
    apiKey: 'GOOGLE_FONTS_API_KEY',
  }),
];

```

Want full control? You can also create custom font providers to support internal font libraries, enterprise DAMs, or self-hosted fonts. The Font Manager system is fully extensible‚Äîso you can plug in whatever source you need.

## Available Everywhere

Font support is fully integrated across all Studio project types:

- üåê **Web Projects** ‚Äì Apply dynamic or branded fonts to websites, landing pages, and more  
- ‚úâÔ∏è **Email Projects** ‚Äì Use web-safe or inline-compatible fonts in transactional and marketing emails  
- üñ®Ô∏è **Document Projects** ‚Äì Bring typography consistency to printed materials like labels, invoices, and badges  

Wherever you design, your fonts go with you.

## Designed for Teams & Brand Control

If you're building white-labeled editors or enterprise tooling, the Font Manager helps ensure every user creates on-brand content:

- Preconfigure font sets by client or workspace  
- Lock down default font styles per project type  
- Dynamically inject fonts based on user role, locale, or device  

And since it's all HTML + CSS under the hood, exported content stays portable and standards-compliant.

## Final Thoughts

Fonts aren't just decoration‚Äîthey're part of your brand‚Äôs identity. With the new Font Manager in Studio SDK, you're no longer limited to system defaults.

Whether you're building a WYSIWYG editor, a branded content platform, or just want cleaner-looking output, full typography control is now at your fingertips.
