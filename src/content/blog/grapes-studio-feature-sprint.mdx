The latest Grapes Studio update is all about momentum. We focused on the everyday moments where teams need faster answers, clearer next steps, and less friction between a fresh idea and a live, branded site. Here’s what’s new.

---

## 3× Faster AI Responses

We rebuilt our AI pipeline to deliver streaming output in seconds. Prompts now return a visible response almost immediately, making it feel natural to iterate on copy, layouts, and design variations without long wait times.

- Responses begin streaming in roughly a second, even on larger prompts.
- Rendering never blocks you from editing or sending follow-up messages.
- The speed boost compounds when you’re co-editing across multiple pages.

## Tutorial Helper for Complete Launches

A new tutorial helper keeps teams on track from the first wireframe to an end-to-end deployment. It highlights the next best action based on where you are in the build process—designing content, publishing, or adding a custom domain—so you reach “Ship it!” faster.

- Step-by-step guidance appears contextually in Studio.
- Includes deployment and domain checklists, not just design tips.
- Perfect for onboarding new teammates or agency clients.

## Turnkey Domains (and Free Subdomains)

Domains just got easier:

- **Pro Tier**: Buy and configure a custom domain directly in Grapes Studio. DNS records are provisioned automatically, so there’s no registrar hopping or TXT-record copy/paste.
- **Free Tier**: Prefer a quick launch? Publish with a custom subdomain on `grapesstudio.ai`—ideal for prototypes, approvals, or campaign microsites.

Either way, Studio applies SSL and keeps everything in sync with your deployment settings.

## Built for Small Businesses

These releases keep Grapes Studio the most cost-effective alternative to Wix and Squarespace for small businesses that need to launch fast without sacrificing polish. Affordable pricing, turnkey domains, and hands-on AI support make it simple for:

- Plumbers, carpenters, and roofers showcasing services and reviews.
- Cleaners and home maintenance teams scheduling new jobs.
- Cafés, restaurants, and bakeries posting menus and daily updates.

We’re continuing to invest in the features that matter most to local teams: fast iteration, ready-to-go templates, and painless deployment on a custom domain—whether you’re just getting started or refreshing your brand.

## One-Click Migration That Brings Everything Along

Studio’s one-click migration tool keeps improving too. You can still import layouts and content from Wix, Squarespace, or custom HTML in minutes—and now our team can pull media libraries, documents, and other assets over for you when needed.

- Preserve page structure and navigation automatically.
- Bring assets—logos, galleries, downloads—into the Studio asset manager.
- Get live support to finish the import if you’re migrating a larger catalog.

Moving a local business site to Grapes Studio stays painless, so you can lean on our speed upgrades and domain automation without rebuilding from scratch.

## Conversational Control of Studio

The AI assistant can now do more than suggest content—it can execute actions. Ask it to deploy your latest changes, open the settings you need, or surface the right menu in the editor. It’s like having a co-pilot that knows your project context and the Studio UI.

- Deploy and publish directly from chat.
- Jump to any menu or panel with a single request.
- Keep your hands on design work while the assistant handles the busywork.

---

## Magic Link Login for Every Email

Authentication is still passwordless and now provider-agnostic. Enter any email address and we’ll send a magic link. Prefer OAuth? Google and GitHub remain available, but they’re no longer required—great news for clients and stakeholders who don’t live in your workspace tools.

---

## Join the Grapes Studio Discord

We launched a community space for sharing templates, deployment workflows, and feedback directly with the team. Come meet other builders, ask questions, and shape what ships next: [https://discord.gg/PY7gXvWT89](https://discord.gg/PY7gXvWT89).
