## 🎯 Absolute Layout, Now in Studio SDK

Most visual editors prioritize responsive, flow-based design—and for good reason. But not every use case needs that. Sometimes you just want to place something **exactly where you want it**.

Introducing the new **[Absolute Mode](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/plugins/canvas/absolute-mode)** plugin for Studio SDK—built for designs that depend on **precision positioning** rather than responsive flow.

---

## Why Absolute Mode?

This plugin unlocks full **freeform layout control**, making it perfect for:

- 🧾 **Document designs** with fixed fields and signatures  
- 🖨️ **Print-ready layouts** like name tags or shipping labels  
- 💳 **Business cards** with brand-aligned spacing  
- 📽️ **Presentation slides** or static content with layered elements  

If you're building a WYSIWYG experience where pixel-perfect placement matters more than media queries—this mode is for you.

---

## Key Features

Absolute Mode enables free positioning for components directly on the canvas—no CSS hacks or positioning wrappers required.

🔧 **Out of the box, it includes**:

- 🔒 **Axis locking** – Hold `Shift` while dragging to lock X or Y axis  
- 📐 **Snap-to-grid** – Align elements visually with optional grid snapping  
- ⚙️ **Custom enable logic** – Activate absolute positioning based on element type, tag, or style  

It’s enabled by default for all components—but you can configure it to behave exactly how your project demands.

---

## Built for Document Mode—and Beyond

Absolute Mode was built with **[Document Projects](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/project-types/document)** in mind, but it works across all web based layout types:

- Web: Drag-and-place hero banners, image carousels, or decorative elements  
- Documents: Precisely align content for print, including barcodes, text blocks, and more  

Combine it with Studio SDK’s **Snap Lines**, **Rulers**, and **Grid Overlays** for a complete precision design toolkit.

---

## Developer Control

Want to limit when Absolute Mode activates? You can pass custom logic to toggle it based on:

- The element’s CSS (e.g. `position: absolute`)  
- The tag name or component type  
- User-defined metadata  

This gives you total control over how and when your users can access freeform positioning.
