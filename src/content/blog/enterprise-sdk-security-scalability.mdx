## Leading Enterprises Trust GrapesJS SDK

When enterprise companies need a visual builder that can handle their scale, security requirements, and customization needs, they turn to the **[Grapes Studio SDK](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/overview/getting-started)**. Today, we're excited to share how two industry leaders—**ByteDance** (the parent company of TikTok) and **Microsoft**—are leveraging GrapesJS to power critical parts of their platforms.

**ByteDance** uses the Studio SDK for internal email creation, enabling their teams to build professional emails without compromising data security. **Microsoft** relies on GrapesJS to power **Power Pages**, their low-code website builder within the Power Platform ecosystem.

While these use cases demonstrate the SDK's versatility, the real story is about the three core benefits that make the SDK ideal for enterprise deployments: **security**, **scalability**, and **flexibility**.

## Security: Keep Your Data In-House

For enterprise organizations, data security isn't just a feature—it's a fundamental requirement. The Grapes Studio SDK enables companies to maintain complete control over their data and infrastructure.

### ByteDance's Security-First Approach

ByteDance chose the Studio SDK for their internal email creation workflow specifically because it allows them to keep sensitive data completely in-house. Instead of routing email content through third-party services that require database access, their teams can create professional emails directly within their own infrastructure.

**Key Security Benefits:**

- **No Third-Party Database Access** — The SDK runs entirely on the front-end, meaning email content never needs to be sent to external services for processing
- **Self-Hosted Data** — All project data, templates, and assets remain on ByteDance's servers
- **Backend Control** — They handle email delivery through their own backend systems, maintaining full control over the entire email pipeline
- **Zero Vendor Lock-In** — No dependency on external services means no risk of data exposure or vendor security breaches

This approach is particularly critical for companies handling sensitive internal communications, customer data, or proprietary information. By keeping everything in-house, ByteDance eliminates the security risks that come with third-party integrations.

### Why Security Matters for Enterprise

Traditional embeddable builders often require you to send user data to external servers for processing, storage, or rendering. This creates several security concerns:

- **Data Exposure Risk** — User content passes through third-party infrastructure
- **Compliance Challenges** — GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulations require careful data handling
- **Vendor Security Dependencies** — Your security posture depends on your vendor's practices
- **Audit Complexity** — Tracking data flows becomes more difficult with external services

The Studio SDK eliminates these concerns by running entirely on your infrastructure. Your data never leaves your environment, giving you complete control over security policies, compliance requirements, and data governance.

## Scalability: Built for Enterprise Growth

Enterprise companies need solutions that scale with their business—not just in terms of users, but also in terms of use cases, integrations, and performance requirements.

### Front-End Architecture for Unlimited Scale

One of the SDK's most powerful advantages is its **front-end architecture**. Unlike solutions that tie you into specific email or web client services, the Studio SDK runs entirely in the browser. This means:

- **No Client Limitations** — You're not locked into a specific email service provider or web hosting platform
- **Horizontal Scaling** — Each user's editor runs independently in their browser, so there's no backend bottleneck
- **Resource Efficiency** — Processing happens client-side, reducing server load and infrastructure costs
- **Global Performance** — No dependency on external APIs means faster load times and better reliability

### Microsoft Power Pages: Scaling Visual Building

Microsoft's use of GrapesJS in **Power Pages** demonstrates how the framework scales to serve millions of users. Power Pages enables businesses to create websites, portals, and applications within the Microsoft ecosystem, and GrapesJS provides the visual editing experience that makes it accessible to non-technical users.

By leveraging GrapesJS as a framework rather than a closed platform, Microsoft can:

- **Customize the Experience** — Tailor the editor to match Power Pages' specific workflows and requirements
- **Integrate Seamlessly** — Connect the visual builder directly with Microsoft's data sources, authentication, and deployment systems
- **Scale Globally** — Serve users worldwide without worrying about third-party service limits or availability
- **Maintain Control** — Keep the entire user experience within Microsoft's infrastructure and branding

This scalability isn't just about handling more users—it's about supporting diverse use cases, from simple landing pages to complex business applications, all within a single, flexible framework.

## Flexibility: A Framework, Not a Platform

The most significant advantage of the GrapesJS is that **GrapesJS is a framework**, not a closed platform. This fundamental difference enables the kind of customization and integration that enterprise companies require.

### Complete Customization Control

Unlike embeddable builders that force you into their UI, workflows, and limitations, the GrapesJS gives you complete control:

- **UI Customization** — Match the editor's appearance to your brand and application design
- **Workflow Integration** — Integrate with your existing tools, APIs, and business processes
- **Feature Extension** — Add custom components, plugins, and functionality specific to your needs
- **Framework Access** — Leverage the full GrapesJS API for advanced customization

### Real-World Flexibility Examples

**ByteDance's Custom Email Workflow:**
- Custom email templates tailored to their internal communication needs
- Integration with their backend email delivery system
- Branded editor interface matching their internal tools
- Custom components for their specific email requirements

**Microsoft Power Pages Integration:**
- Seamless integration with Microsoft Dataverse and Power Platform
- Custom components that connect to Microsoft data sources
- Workflow integration with Power Automate and other Microsoft services
- Branded experience consistent with Microsoft's design language

This flexibility means you're not adapting your business processes to fit a tool—you're adapting the tool to fit your business processes.

## Why Enterprises Choose the SDK Over Alternatives

When evaluating visual builder solutions, enterprise companies face a critical choice: build from scratch, use a closed platform, or leverage a flexible framework like the Studio SDK.

### Building from Scratch: Time and Resource Intensive

Creating a visual builder from scratch requires:
- Months or years of development time
- Ongoing maintenance and feature development
- Deep expertise in complex UI/UX challenges
- Significant upfront and ongoing costs

### Closed Platforms: Limited and Locked-In

Traditional embeddable builders often:
- Force you into their UI and workflows via iframes
- Require sending data to external servers
- Limit customization and integration options
- Create vendor lock-in for your users' data

### The Studio SDK: Best of Both Worlds

The Studio SDK provides:
- ✅ **Production-Ready Solution** — Fully functional visual builder out of the box
- ✅ **Complete Control** — Self-hosted, fully customizable, no vendor lock-in
- ✅ **Framework Flexibility** — Extend and customize via GrapesJS APIs
- ✅ **Enterprise Security** — Keep all data in-house
- ✅ **Unlimited Scalability** — Front-end architecture scales with your needs
- ✅ **Proven at Scale** — Trusted by companies like ByteDance and Microsoft
