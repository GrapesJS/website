## The Challenge to WordPress

For over two decades, small businesses have relied on WordPress to power their websites—paying high hosting fees, juggling plugins, and dealing with constant updates. Our mission is to challenge that model with a platform that offers:

- **AI-powered editing** that understands your design intent
- **HTML-first approach** that generates clean, portable code
- **Total ownership** of your website and its code
- **Significant cost savings** of up to 75% on hosting and maintenance
- **One-click imports** from any existing website

Unlike AI builders that lock you into proprietary systems, Grapes Studio generates clean HTML and CSS you can host anywhere—forever.

## What's Next: The Road Ahead

**Enhanced AI Capabilities**: We're working on more sophisticated AI features that will make website creation even more intuitive and powerful.

**Expanded Integration Ecosystem**: Look for deeper integrations with popular tools and platforms that businesses use every day.

**Advanced Template Library**: A growing collection of professionally designed templates that showcase the full potential of our platform.

**Community-Driven Features**: As we grow, we'll be incorporating more community feedback and feature requests to ensure Grapes Studio evolves in the direction that serves our users best.
