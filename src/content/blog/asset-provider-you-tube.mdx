In this post, I'll walk you through the highlights of our **latest release** to the Studio SDK, or pro version of GrapesJS. We've worked hard over the past month to bring you powerful new features and improvements aimed at making integrations and customizations more intuitive, while also enhancing the onboarding experience for new users. From Asset Providers to a YouTube Asset Provider Plugin, hereâ€™s whatâ€™s new and how it can streamline your development workflow.

## Asset Providers â€“ Integrate External Sources and Load Custom Asset Types

Weâ€™re thrilled to introduce [Asset Providers](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/configuration/assets/asset-providers), a flexible way to connect external sources (APIs, libraries, and more) and load various asset types, such as images, videos, and documents, **directly within the editor**.

- **Streamlined integration**: Fetch and display content from any external source (like media libraries or custom endpoints).
- **Centralized experience**: Provide editors easy, in-app access to all your media.
- **Configurable and extensible**: Tailor the provider logic to suit your projectâ€™s workflow and naming conventions.

## YouTube Asset Provider Plugin â€“ Browse and Select Videos In-Editor

Our first demonstration of the new Asset Providers API is the [YouTube Asset Provider Plugin](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/plugins/asset-providers/youtube-asset-provider), allowing users to search and embed YouTube videos right from the editor interface.

- **Faster content creation**: Find YouTube videos without ever leaving your workspace.
- **Seamless preview and insertion**: Quickly review video thumbnails and embed them with a single click.

## Empty State Plugin â€“ Fully Customizable Placeholder Elements

To further improve onboarding (and to add flexibility for advanced users), weâ€™re introducing the [Empty State Plugin](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/plugins/canvas/emptyState). This feature **injects custom elements** into empty components, ensuring users always have helpful placeholders when thereâ€™s no content to display. It provides the clarity many companies are looking for to help their users get started and allows you to get similiar functionality to rich text editors like N1ED.

- **Enhanced user experience**: Reduce confusion by showing explanatory text or images in unused sections.
- **On-brand placeholders**: Tailor the look and feel of your empty components to match your design.
- **Adaptive for any scenario**: Provide tutorials, tips, or dynamic content suggestions in place of blank canvases.

## Expanded Component Methods Documentation â€“ Power and Flexibility

Weâ€™ve also **expanded our documentation** to cover **Component Methods** in greater depth, catering to developers who want to extend or customize GrapesJS components.

- **Deeper insights**: Dive into the under-the-hood functionality of each component.
- **Step-by-step guides**: Learn best practices for modifying default behaviors or crafting entirely new components.
- **Advanced examples**: Reference hands-on code snippets showcasing real-world component extensions.
