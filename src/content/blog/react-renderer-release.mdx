## React Rendering Comes to Studio SDK ‚öõÔ∏è

We‚Äôre thrilled to announce a powerful new addition to the [Studio SDK plugin ecosystem](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/plugins/overview): the [React Renderer plugin](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/plugins/custom-renderer/react).

This marks a major milestone for developers building component-driven applications and wanting visual editing capabilities that speak the same language as their frontends.

Whether you're running Next.js or shipping a custom component library, Studio SDK now gives you **direct visual editing of React components**.

---

## What This Unlocks

The new [react renderer plugin](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/plugins/custom-renderer/react) allows you to:

- üîÅ **Replace the default HTML canvas with a React renderer**
- üß± **Use your own React components inside the editor**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Add Pages and Blocks using JSX or HTML, auto-parsed into React elements**
- üñ•Ô∏è **Render entire saved projects with a React component‚Äîeven with SSR**

This isn‚Äôt just a minor enhancement. It‚Äôs a **paradigm shift** for how Grapes JS, both our studio and OS offering, integrates into modern app stacks.

---

## Why React Rendering?

Component-based frameworks are the default for modern web UIs. Until now, visual editing platforms struggled to cleanly support those workflows.

With the React Renderer plugin, your React components can now be used in Grapes Studio, but also installed as a plugin into the Open Source version of GrapesJS:

- Use props, slots, and events natively  
- Preserve styling and interactivity  
- Maintain one codebase across design and production  

This means you can finally bridge the gap between **developer-authored components** and **user-generated content**‚Äîwithout losing structure, performance, or flexibility.

---

## How It Works

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of how to get started.

Import the plugin: 

```js

import StudioEditor from '@grapesjs/studio-sdk/react';
import '@grapesjs/studio-sdk/style';

// Import React renderer plugin
import rendererReact from '@grapesjs/studio-sdk-plugins/dist/rendererReact';

```

Now you can define your components: 

```js
const reactRendererConfig = {
  components: {
    Hero: {
      component: Hero,
      props: () => [
        {
          type: 'text',
          name: 'title',
          label: 'Title'
        },
        {
          type: 'text',
          name: 'subtitle',
          label: 'Subtitle',
          value: 'Default Subtitle'
        }
      ],
    },
  }
};
```

Now initalize the editor:

```js
<StudioEditor
  options={{
    plugins: [
      rendererReact.init(reactRendererConfig),
      (editor) => {
        editor.Blocks.add('feature', {
          label: 'Feature component',
          category: 'React',
          full: true,
          content: <Feature title="Feature title" description="Feature description" />
        }, { at: 0 });
      }
    ],
    project: {
      type: 'react',
      default: {
        pages: [
          {
            name: 'Page from React',
            component: (
              <>
                <Hero title="Build Visually with React" subtitle="A seamless editing experience using your components"/>
                <Section>
                  <h2 data-gjs-type="heading" style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '2rem' }}>Features</h2>
                  <Feature title="Modular Components" description="Build and edit with reusable UI blocks." />
                  <Feature title="HTML to React" description="Convert legacy HTML into structured React." />
                  <Button label="Get Started" href="#start" />
                </Section>
              </>
            )
          },
          {
            name: 'Page from HTML',
            component: `
              <h1>React Components from HTML</h1>
              <div data-gjs-type="Hero" title="React from HTML"></div>
              <style>
                body { font-family: system-ui; }
              </style>
            `
          }
        ]
      }
    },
  }}
/>
```

## Ideal Use Cases

This plugin is perfect for teams that:

- Are building **custom design systems** or **white-labeled page builders**  
- Want to **re-use production React components** in a WYSIWYG context  
- Need **server-side rendering (SSR)** for React content  
- Are replacing legacy CMS editors with **dynamic React-based editing**  
- Want to provide **live previews** of marketing components, modals, or dashboards  

No more exporting HTML and trying to parse it back into components. Now, your content pipeline stays **React-native from start to finish**.

---

## SSR, Frameworks, and Flexibility

The React Renderer supports both **client-side rendering** and **server-side rendering**, making it ideal for Next.js, Remix, or other SSR-first frameworks.

Projects can be saved as JSON and later rendered wherever needed‚Äîlanding pages, email previews, admin dashboards‚Äîusing your **actual app components**.

---

## Final Thoughts

This is a major step forward for Studio SDK, especially for teams who live in React. With this new plugin:

- You get full visual editing of your **own** components  
- You can render pages anywhere using **structured, component-safe data**  
- You can create smarter, more maintainable editors without duplication  

It's visual editing, the React way.
