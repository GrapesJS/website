## Meet the New Document Project Type in Studio 🖨️

We’re excited to introduce **[Document Projects](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/projects/document/overview)**—a brand-new mode in Studio SDK tailored specifically for printable layouts. Whether you're designing invoices, business cards, event badges, or product labels, the new Document type gives you the flexibility of web tech with the precision of desktop publishing.

Just like our web and email builders, this new mode is fully visual, highly customizable, and powered by HTML—no vendor lock-in or obscure formats.

## Why We Built It

Many users were already bending the Web Project type to suit printable use cases. So we built something better—an experience optimized for document creation while preserving everything great about our existing Studio stack.

Now, print-focused projects get:

- **Consistent dimensions** across screens and printers  
- **Accurate print previews** right inside the editor  
- **Standardized formats** like A4, A5, letter, and more  

And because it’s all still HTML under the hood, your documents are easy to version, extend, and export.

## What You Can Create

The new Document mode is ideal for:

- 📄 **Invoices** with dynamic data  
- 🪪 **Badges** with names, roles, and QR codes  
- 🏷️ **Labels** for products or packaging  
- 💼 **Business cards** with custom layouts  
- 🧾 **Forms and printables** with user-specific details  

Anything you need to render as a clean, print-ready document—Studio SDK now supports out of the box.

## Key Features

Document mode includes specialized tools to make print layout design a breeze:

- 📐 **Predefined printable formats** – Choose from A4, A5, US Letter, and more  
- 🖥️ **Accurate on-screen previews** – See exactly how your design will print  
- 🖨️ **Utility print commands** – Like *Print All Pages* and *Preview Page Range*  
- 🧩 **Plugin compatibility** – Use the same features you rely on, like [Global Styles](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/configuration/global-styles), [Assets](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/configuration/assets/overview), and [Data Sources](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/configuration/datasources/overview) 

Because it’s built on the same foundation as Web Projects, you can reuse components, apply consistent styling, and manage data-driven content just like you would for any other Studio project.

## Built for Developers, Loved by Designers

Every Document project is just clean HTML, styled with CSS, and managed visually. That means:

- ✅ Easy version control  
- ✅ No special file formats  
- ✅ Full access to Studio SDK's plugin and API ecosystem  

Whether you’re building a one-off template or deploying hundreds of variations, Document mode scales with your workflow.
