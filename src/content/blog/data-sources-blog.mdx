## Data Sources â€“ Dynamic Templates, Made Easy

The newest addition to the Studio SDK is here: **[Data Sources](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/configuration/datasources/overview)**â€”a feature that brings structured data into the design workflow, without requiring a single line of code. Whether you're building personalized emails, smart documents, or adaptive web pages, Data Sources empower your users to create content that changes with the data behind it.

From looping through product listings to conditionally showing content, this release unlocks a whole new level of design flexibility.

---

## What You Can Do

Data Sources let users visually build dynamic templates that respond to real data. Key capabilities include:

- **Binding variables directly to components**, like inserting a user's name or product details
- **Showing or hiding content** based on custom conditions
- **Exporting finished designs** with either fully-resolved content or as merge-tagâ€“ready templates for use with third-party tools

Best of all? It's all done inside the editorâ€”with simple configuration, no scripting required.

---

## Designed for Real-World Use Cases

Data Sources are perfect for a range of projects, including:

- **Personalized email campaigns** that greet users by name or feature tailored content  
- **Smart business documents** that adapt based on form inputs or stored values  
- **Data-rich web pages** like product catalogs, event schedules, or user dashboards  

With Data Sources, anyone can build templates that feel custom-madeâ€”without ever touching the codebase.

---

## Built-In Blocks, Intuitive UI

The Studio SDK includes purpose-built blocks that make using Data Sources feel natural. Users can drag in pre-configured elements, then select the data they want to bindâ€”all through an intuitive visual interface. No need to learn syntax, set up APIs, or toggle between modes. Just connect and go.

---

## One Central Source of Truth

Instead of duplicating values across multiple components, users can **centralize their data** and reuse it throughout pages and templates. That means less maintenance, more consistency, and better control across projects.

---

## Flexible Export Options

Depending on your workflow, Data Sources support two primary export modes:

- **Resolved Output** â€“ Exports the final, populated content, ready to publish
- **Merge Tag Templates** â€“ Exports templates with variable placeholders for external systems like CRMs, ESPs, or document engines

This flexibility allows teams to design once and deploy anywhere.

## Looking Ahead

Weâ€™re just getting started. Coming soon:

- ðŸ‘‰ **Dynamic styles and visibility** powered by data (think: color-coding, spacing, toggles)  
- ðŸ‘‰ **Direct external data connections**, right from the editor  
- ðŸ‘‰ **Live data previews** with seamless toggle modes  

This is the foundation of a **fully visual, fully programmable** design systemâ€”and weâ€™re excited to bring you along for the ride.

## Final Thoughts

With Data Sources, Studio SDK becomes more than a design toolâ€”it becomes a dynamic content platform. By enabling your users to design with structured data, you unlock smarter templates, faster workflows, and more powerful personalization.

If your projects require logic, flexibility, or just a little more intelligence behind the scenesâ€”Data Sources is the solution.
