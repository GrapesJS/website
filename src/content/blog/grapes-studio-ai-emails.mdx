## Why Grapes Studio for Email Creation?

Traditional email design tools often fall short in a few key areas: they lock you into proprietary formats, make responsive design difficult, or require extensive coding knowledge. Grapes Studio solves all of these problems.

Here's what makes Grapes Studio the ideal choice for email creation:

### AI-Powered Email Generation

Simply describe what you want, and Grapes Studio's AI will generate a complete email template in seconds. Need a "product announcement email for a new software launch" or a "holiday newsletter with festive colors"? Just type your vision, and watch as AI creates a professional, responsive email layout complete with:

- Structured layouts optimized for email clients
- Professional styling and color schemes
- Responsive components that work on all devices
- Industry-standard email components

No more starting from scratch or hunting for templates. AI handles the heavy lifting, so you can focus on perfecting the message and branding.

### Visual Drag-and-Drop Editing

Once AI generates your email, the visual editor lets you fine-tune every detail. Adjust spacing, colors, fonts, and layouts with intuitive point-and-click controls. Swap components, rearrange sections, and preview your changes in real-time—all without writing a single line of code.

## MJML: The Foundation of Reliable Emails

One of Grapes Studio's biggest advantages is its use of **[MJML](https://mjml.io/)** (Mailjet Markup Language) as the default email format. If you're not familiar with MJML, here's why it's a game-changer:

### What is MJML?

MJML is a markup language designed specifically for email. It abstracts away the complexity of email HTML (which is notoriously inconsistent across clients) into a simple, semantic syntax. Instead of wrestling with table-based layouts and inline CSS compatibility, you work with clean, logical components.

### Benefits of MJML

**1. Cross-Client Compatibility**

Email clients are notoriously inconsistent. Outlook uses Word's rendering engine. Gmail strips certain CSS. Apple Mail behaves differently than iOS Mail. MJML handles all of these quirks automatically, generating bulletproof HTML that renders correctly everywhere.

**2. Responsive by Default**

Mobile email opens account for over 40% of all email interactions. MJML components are mobile-responsive out of the box. Your emails automatically adapt to screen sizes without extra coding or testing.

**3. Maintainable and Clean**

Traditional email HTML is a mess of nested tables, inline styles, and vendor-specific hacks. MJML code is clean, readable, and easy to maintain. A simple `<mj-section>` and `<mj-column>` structure replaces pages of complex table markup.

**4. Component-Based Architecture**

MJML provides pre-built components for common email elements:
- `<mj-section>` and `<mj-column>` for layouts
- `<mj-text>` for typography
- `<mj-button>` for CTAs
- `<mj-image>` for images
- `<mj-divider>` for separators
- And many more

These components are battle-tested across millions of emails, ensuring reliability.

**5. Future-Proof**

As email clients evolve, MJML adapts. The MJML community continuously updates the framework to support new email client features and fix rendering issues, so your emails stay current without constant maintenance.

### How Grapes Studio Uses MJML

In Grapes Studio, when you create an email project, everything runs on MJML under the hood. You design visually, but the output is clean, standards-based MJML that compiles to perfect HTML. This means:

- Your emails work across all major email clients
- The code is maintainable and exportable
- You can leverage the full MJML ecosystem
- Your designs are future-proof

## Direct Mailchimp Export

Once you've created your email in Grapes Studio, getting it into your email marketing platform shouldn't require copy-pasting HTML or manual workarounds. That's why we've built **direct Mailchimp export** right into the editor.

### How It Works

With Mailchimp integration, you can:

- **Export directly to Mailchimp** with a single click
- **Preserve all styling and formatting** automatically
- **Maintain responsive layouts** without extra configuration
- **Update existing campaigns** or create new ones

No more downloading HTML files, importing them manually, or fixing broken layouts in Mailchimp's editor. Your Grapes Studio design becomes a Mailchimp campaign instantly.

### Why This Matters

Time is money, especially in marketing. The Mailchimp export eliminates hours of tedious manual work and ensures pixel-perfect consistency between your design and your sent emails. It also reduces the risk of errors—no more accidentally breaking layouts during the import process.

## Coming Soon: Constant Contact and Klaviyo Integrations

We know that different teams use different email service providers. Mailchimp is just the beginning.

**Constant Contact Integration** — Coming soon, you'll be able to export your Grapes Studio emails directly to Constant Contact campaigns, maintaining the same seamless workflow for teams using this platform.

**Klaviyo Integration** — We're also working on Klaviyo support, enabling direct export to one of the most popular platforms for e-commerce email marketing.

These integrations will work just like the Mailchimp export: design once in Grapes Studio, export to your ESP of choice, and send. No code, no hassle, no compatibility issues. We're working hard to add a number of new integration in the coming months, which you can find [here](https://grapesjs.com/ai/integrations).
