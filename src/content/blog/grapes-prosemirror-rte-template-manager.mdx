The latest **Grapes Studio SDK** release is packed with awesome new features to make your web, email, and PDF editing experience even better. We've added the [Template Manager](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/configuration/templates) and the [ProseMirror RTE Plugin](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/plugins/rte/prosemirror), giving developers more flexibility to create and manage content with ease.

Plus, we've improved how tables work with a new plugin and made it easier to get started with our new free plan. Lots of good stuff to explor, let's dive in!


# Template Manager: Making Content Reuse a Breeze

We're excited to introduce the Template Manager, a game-changer that lets users pick ready-made templates as a starting point for their projects. Whether it's emails, web pages, or PDFs, the Template Manager makes it easy to create, reuse, and customize content efficiently.

It's built on top of our flexible [Layout system](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/configuration/layout/overview), so you have complete control over [how and where](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/configuration/layout/components#paneltemplates) templates appear in your application.


## What makes it awesome
- **Easy HTML-based templates**: Set up templates with multiple pages and simple HTML strings.
- **Centralized template management**: Store and organize all your templates on your own infrastructure.
- **Fully customizable**: Create tailored designs for emails, web pages, or PDFs that fit your users' needs.

For example, if you're building an **email marketing platform**, your users can select a pre-built template, tweak it to match their brand, and save it for future campaigns. This means less hassle, more consistency, and faster workflows, all while keeping things flexible and user-friendly.

Say hello to the **ProseMirror RTE Plugin**, our latest upgrade that brings powerful and flexible rich-text editing to Studio SDK. Whether you're crafting emails, web pages, or documents, this plugin, built on the trusted [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net) framework, makes editing smoother and more customizable than ever.

### Why It Matters
A solid rich text editor can make all the difference in your users' workflow. With the ProseMirror RTE Plugin, you get:
- **More Formatting Options**:  Users can easily add bold, italics, underlines, lists, and links to make content shine.
- **A Smooth Experience**: Intuitive controls that make content creation a breeze.
- **Developer Customization**: Extend or tweak the plugin to suit niche requirements.

# Table Plugin: Simplifying Data Presentation

The GrapesJS has a basic support for table elements but we've taken it a step further with a dedicated plugin. Now you can manage table elements with more advanced controls like managing rows and columns, merging and splitting cells, and more.

All of the commands are also easily accessable via the context menu.

You can check and play around with this plugin directly in our docs: [Table Plugin Documentation](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/plugins/components/table)
