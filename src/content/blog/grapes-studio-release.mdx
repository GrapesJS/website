## AI Meets Visual Design

Grapes Studio's AI assistant understands your vision and translates it into beautiful web designs. Simply describe what you wantâ€”"a modern portfolio for a photographer" or "a sleek landing page for a tech startup"â€”and watch as AI generates complete layouts, selects appropriate components, and applies professional styling.

The visual editor then lets you refine every detail with familiar drag-and-drop controls, making adjustments as natural as moving furniture in your living room.

---

## Clone, Customize, Create

One of Grapes Studio's most powerful features is website cloning. Found a design you love? Simply input the URL and Studio will analyze the structure, layout, and stylingâ€”then recreate it as an editable template in your workspace. From there, customize colors, fonts, content, and layout to make it uniquely yours.

This isn't just copyingâ€”it's intelligent reverse engineering that gives you a fully functional starting point for your own creative vision.

## Clean, Standards-Based Output

Unlike complex frameworks that lock you into specific ecosystems, Grapes Studio exports clean, semantic HTML and CSS that works everywhere. Your websites are built with:

- **Standard HTML5** â€“ Semantic markup that's accessible, SEO-friendly, and fast
- **Modern CSS** â€“ Clean stylesheets without framework bloat
- **No Dependencies** â€“ No React, Vue, or Angular complexity to maintain

Deploy to any hosting provider, integrate with any backend, and maintain your code with confidence.
