## Grid Mode Plugin â€“ The Power of CSS Grid, Now Visual

CSS Grid is one of the most powerful layout systems in modern web developmentâ€”but up until now, working with it has meant writing complex code or relying on trial-and-error in the browser. With the **[Grid Mode Plugin](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/plugins/canvas/grid-mode)**, that changes. Its available in both our OS version of Grapes, and our Studio SDK.

Weâ€™ve taken the flexibility of CSS Grid and made it **visual, intuitive, and interactive**â€”so you can design sophisticated layouts right on the canvas without touching a line of CSS.

### Why Grid?

CSS Grid gives you the ability to create **two-dimensional layouts**â€”both rows and columnsâ€”with precise control over spacing, alignment, and responsiveness. Whether you're building marketing pages, dashboards, or editorial layouts, Grid helps structure content in ways that Flexbox alone canâ€™t.

But while Grid is powerful, it hasnâ€™t always been accessible to non-developers. Thatâ€™s where Grid Mode comes in.

## Drag, Drop, and Design â€“ No Code Required

With Grid Mode enabled, any element with `display: grid`  becomes a **visually editable container**. Inside the editor, you can:

- **Drag and resize grid items** directly on the canvas  
- **Adjust gaps, alignment, and templates** from the Style Manager  
- **Define and modify grid areas** without diving into dev tools  
- **Quickly preview changes** across breakpoints and screen sizes  

Itâ€™s a fast, friendly way to build even the most intricate designs.

## A Better Workflow for Teams

Grid Mode bridges the gap between designers and developers:

- **Designers** can take control of layout without writing code  
- **Developers** can trust that the underlying CSS stays clean  
- **Product teams** can iterate faster, with fewer back-and-forths  

Combined with other Studio SDK pluginsâ€”like [accordion](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/plugins/components/accordion), or our [rich text editor options](https://app.grapesjs.com/docs-sdk/plugins/rte/tinymce)â€”you can build and manage complete websites or apps with professional-grade layout tools. While best used within our Studio SDK, this plugin can be used in both our open source version of GrapesJS or Grapes SDK, all that's required is a license key.
