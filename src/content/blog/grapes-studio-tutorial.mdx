## Creating Your First Project

To get started with Grapes Studio, head over to [https://grapesjs.com](https://grapesjs.com) and sign up for a free account. Once you're logged in, you'll see the dashboard where you can create new projects.

### Starting from Scratch

3. Select whether you want to start with a blank canvas or choose from templates
4. Give your project a name and click **"Create"**

### Using AI to Generate Your Website

One of the most powerful features of Grapes Studio is the AI assistant. Instead of starting from scratch, you can describe what you want and let AI build it for you:

2. Enter a description of your website (e.g., "A modern portfolio website for a photographer with a dark theme")
3. Click **"Generate"** and wait for AI to create your website
4. Review the generated design and start customizing

## Visual Editing Basics

Once your project is created, you'll enter the visual editor. This is where the magic happens.

### The Editor Interface

The Grapes Studio editor is divided into several key areas:

- **Canvas**: The main editing area where you build your website
- **Layers Panel**: View and manage all components in your page
- **Styles Panel**: Customize colors, fonts, spacing, and more
- **Components Panel**: Drag and drop new elements onto your page

### Adding Components

To add new elements to your page:

1. Open the **Components Panel** on the left side
2. Browse through available components (Text, Image, Button, Container, etc.)
3. Click and drag a component onto the canvas
4. Drop it where you want it positioned

### Editing Text

Editing text is as simple as clicking on it:

1. Click any text element on the canvas
2. The text becomes editable directly
3. Type your new content
4. Click outside to save changes

### Styling Elements

To customize the appearance of any element:

1. Select the element you want to style
2. Open the **Styles Panel** on the right
3. Adjust properties like:
   - Colors (background, text, borders)
   - Typography (font family, size, weight)
   - Spacing (padding, margin)
   - Layout (width, height, alignment)
   - Effects (shadows, borders, opacity)

## Using AI to Enhance Your Design

The AI assistant isn't just for initial generation—you can use it throughout your editing process.

### AI-Powered Suggestions

While editing, you can ask AI for help:

- **"Add a call-to-action section"**
- **"Create a hero section with a background image"**
- **"Suggest better colors for this section"**

The AI understands context and will generate appropriate components based on your current design.

### Website Cloning

One of Grapes Studio's standout features is the ability to clone existing websites:

1. Click the **"Clone Website"** button
2. Enter the URL of the website you want to replicate
3. Wait for Grapes Studio to analyze and recreate the design
4. The cloned website appears as an editable template in your workspace

This is perfect for:
- Recreating a design you love
- Converting a static site into an editable template
- Learning from existing designs
- Quickly starting with a proven layout
